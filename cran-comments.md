## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have addressed the issues raised
during the CRAN incoming checks.

## CRAN comments

### Issue 1

NOTE:

Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  CTE (9:14, 9:98)
  Temeprature (9:74)

Unknown, possibly misspelled, fields in DESCRIPTION:
  'Organization'

No Authors@R field in DESCRIPTION.
Please add one.

**Response:**  
Corrected spelling errors in the DESCRIPTION file and reformatted the
Description field so it does not start with the package name.  
Removed the non-standard `Organization` field.  
Added an `Authors@R` field with the appropriate author and maintainer
information.  
Added a LICENSE file.
