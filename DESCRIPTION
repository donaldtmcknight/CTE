Description: Under natural conditions, nest temperatures fluctuate daily around a mean
    value, whereas in captivity they are often held constant. The Constant
    Temperature Equivalent is designed to bridge the gap between the two by
    calculating a single temperature value for wild nests that corresponds with
    the amount of development that would occur in an incubator set to the same
    temperature. The theory and formulas behind this method were developed by
    Professor Author Georges and are implemented here as a single function.
